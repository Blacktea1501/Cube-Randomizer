# Rubik's Cube Randomizer
This is a project that i thought would be fun to create.
It's written in Rust `1.78.0` and depends on `rand` crate for random number generation
and `raylibrs 3.7` for the GUI.

# Compile and run
Clone the repository, cd into the project and run:
```bash
cargo run --release
```
This might be changed in the future and i will add an installation skript.
